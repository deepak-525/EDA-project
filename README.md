# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects

## Project 1: EDA on Brazil Road Accidents (EDA-1)
### Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on road accident data from Brazil to uncover key insights, trends, and patterns. The goal is to analyze various factors contributing to accidents and provide meaningful visualizations.

### Objectives
- Understand the distribution and characteristics of accident data.
- Identify correlations between different factors such as location, time, weather, and severity.
- Handle missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Generate statistical summaries and visual representations of the dataset.

### Key Analysis Performed
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and inconsistencies.
- Univariate & Bivariate Analysis: Understanding variable distributions and relationships.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new meaningful features.
- Visualization: Bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

### Tools & Libraries Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Project 2: EDA on Churn Data for a Telecom Company (EDA-2)
### Overview
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of customer churn data from a telecom company. The aim is to explore customer behavior, retention patterns, and key factors leading to churn.

### Objectives
- Analyze customer churn trends and patterns.
- Identify key factors influencing customer retention and churn.
- Handle missing values and perform data preprocessing.
- Visualize patterns in the data using graphical methods.

### Key Analysis Performed
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and standardizing data.
- Statistical Summary: Mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
- Correlation Analysis: Identifying relationships between features.
- Visualization: Pie charts, histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps.

### Tools & Libraries Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Conclusion
Both projects follow a structured approach to Exploratory Data Analysis, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the datasets. Insights from these analyses can be further used for predictive modeling or decision-making processes in respective domains.
